9. CSS Implementation Notes (new)
  This section outlines how to structure and include CSS for the Pick n Pay site. Use a modular, maintainable approach with a base stylesheet and component-specific files (e.g., base.css, layout.css, components.css, forms.css).

 Accessibility & performance:

Use system or web-safe stack fonts with fallbacks for faster loading.

Minify and concatenate CSS for production.

Prefer CSS variables for theme colors (e.g., --brand-red, --brand-blue).

Ensure at least 4.5:1 contrast for text on backgrounds.

Use prefers-reduced-motion media query to respect user settings.
